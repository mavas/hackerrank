# hackerrank

Recent Python 3.8 solutions for www.HackerRank.com problems.

The purpose of this repository is just for employment purposes only, so as to
showcase my recent work.  This repository only features algorithm and data
structures solutions for computer science problems.

Everything is in Python 3.8+, and each file has test cases at the very bottom.

# More information

After recently traveling back to the HackerRank web site, I noticed that while
although a lot of my solutions were marked "Solved", and while although I do
indeed vaguely remember completing those ones marked "Solved", the web site
deleting my solutions.  I had to implement them, and think about them, all over
again.

So, I made this GitHub repository, to say the least, to preserve those
solutions, and more-so document my work this time - I guess.

Still need to work on:
    - minimum_swaps.py
    - ice_cream_parlor.py
    - get_max.py
