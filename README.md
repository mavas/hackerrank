# hackerrank

Recent Python 3.8 solutions for www.HackerRank.com and www.LeetCode.com problems.

The purpose of this repository is only as a portfolio for employment purposes
only, so as to showcase recent work.  This repository only features algorithm
and data structures solutions for computer science problems.

Everything is in Python 3.8+, and each file has test cases at the very bottom.

# Solutions

- path_sum.py
- Understand use of binary search in ice_cream_parler.py
- Insert a node into a sorted, doubly-linked list.

- Lowest Common Ancestor, (height_tree.py)
- Valid palindrome.

# More information

After recently traveling back to the HackerRank web site, I noticed that while
although a lot of my solutions were marked "Solved", and while although I do
indeed vaguely remember completing those ones marked "Solved", the web site
deleting my solutions.  I had to implement them, and think about them, all over
again.

So, I made this GitHub repository, to say the least, to preserve those
solutions, and more-so document my work this time - I guess.

# TODO

## HackerRank challenges

Still need to work on:
    - minimum_swaps.py
    - ice_cream_parlor.py
    - get_max.py
    - minimum_absolute_difference could be more optimal
